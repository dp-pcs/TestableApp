## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- **Login Flow**: Email/password validation with multiple edge cases
- **Registration Flow**: Multi-field validation with password strength requirements
- **Error Handling**: Real-time validation with user-friendly messaging
- **Test Credentials**: `test@example.com` / `password123`

### 2. E-Commerce Shopping Flow
- **Product Catalog**: 6 products with search and sort functionality
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items, quantity management
- **Checkout Process**: Multi-step form with payment validation
- **Local Storage**: Cart persistence across sessions

### 3. UI Interaction Patterns
- **Modal System**: Accessible modals with keyboard navigation
- **Theme Toggle**: Light/dark mode with system preference detection
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with error recovery

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Data Test IDs**: Comprehensive `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
- **Custom Commands**: Reusable Cypress commands for common workflows
- **Video Recording**: Automatic test execution recording for analysis
- **Bug Injection**: Systematic approach to introduce controlled failures

## 🐛 Bug Injection System

The project includes a sophisticated bug injection system to test detection capabilities:

### Available Bugs

1. **modal-not-closing**: Modal doesn't respond to Escape key or outside clicks
2. **login-always-fails**: Authentication fails even with correct credentials
3. **cart-calculation-wrong**: Total price calculated incorrectly (squares quantity)
4. **ui-misalignment**: Visual elements positioned incorrectly

### Bug Management

```bash
# List available bugs
node scripts/inject-bugs.js list

# Inject specific bug
node scripts/inject-bugs.js inject modal-not-closing

# Restore specific bug
node scripts/inject-bugs.js restore modal-not-closing

# Restore all original files
node scripts/inject-bugs.js restore
```

## 🧪 Testing Approach

### Traditional Testing (Cypress)

**Advantages:**
- Precise element targeting with `data-testid`
- Deterministic test execution
- Comprehensive assertion capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Test Coverage:**
- 30+ test scenarios across authentication, shopping, and UI interactions
- Form validation edge cases
- User workflow end-to-end testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Interactive test runner
npm run test

# Headless execution
npm run test:headless
```

### AI Vision Testing Methodology

**Approach:**
1. **Video Capture**: Record user interactions during normal and broken flows
2. **LLM Analysis**: Submit recordings to vision-capable AI models
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Structured queries to detect specific issues
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against traditional test results

**Sample Prompts:**
- "Watch this login flow. Does the user successfully authenticate?"
- "Compare this shopping cart total with the individual item prices. Is the calculation correct?"
- "Does the modal close when the user clicks outside of it?"

## 🎬 Video Recording Strategy

### Recording Scenarios
1. **Working Flows**: Baseline recordings of successful user journeys
2. **Broken Flows**: Recordings with injected bugs for failure detection
3. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error states
4. **Cross-Device**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport recordings

### Recording Configuration
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 (optimal for AI model processing)
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps for smooth interaction capture
- **Duration**: 30-60 seconds per test scenario
- **Format**: MP4 with H.264 encoding

## 📊 Benchmarking Metrics

### Comparison Criteria

| Metric | Traditional Tests | AI Vision Tests |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|

## 📈 Expected Results & Hypothesis

### Hypothesis
AI vision testing will excel at detecting visual and interaction bugs that traditional tests might miss, while traditional tests will remain superior for functional validation and complex business logic testing.

### Success Metrics
- **Bug Detection Rate**: Percentage of injected bugs caught by each approach
- **False Positive Rate**: Incorrect failure reports
- **Setup Time**: Time required to implement testing
- **Execution Speed**: Time to run complete test suite
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Effort required to maintain tests over time
