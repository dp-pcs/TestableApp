# Video Recording Guide for AI Testing

## Overview
This guide helps you record consistent, high-quality videos for AI vision model testing. Each scenario should be recorded twice: once with working functionality and once with bugs injected.

## Technical Requirements
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 (720p)
- **Frame Rate**: 30 FPS
- **Duration**: 30-75 seconds per scenario
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 encoding preferred)
- **Browser**: Chrome (consistent rendering)
- **Window Size**: Full screen or maximized browser

## Recording Setup
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Set browser zoom to 100%
4. Clear browser data (localStorage, cookies) for consistent starting state
5. Start screen recording software
6. Execute scenario steps slowly and deliberately
7. Stop recording after completing all steps

## Post-Recording Checklist
- [ ] Video is 720p resolution
- [ ] All interactions are clearly visible
- [ ] Video duration is appropriate (30-75 seconds)
- [ ] File named correctly: `videos/{category}/{scenario-id}.mp4`
- [ ] Bug injected scenarios show clear failure behavior
- [ ] Working scenarios show successful completion

## AI Testing Preparation
After recording all videos:
1. Organize files in `videos/working/` and `videos/broken/` folders
2. Test video playback quality
3. Prepare prompts for AI models using `ai-testing/prompts.md`
4. Ready for AI vision model testing phase
