| Sarah Parker Card     | Minor change in text wrapping/justification.           | Subtle          |


**3. Overall Assessment of Visual Quality:**

The visual quality of the TEST version is largely unchanged from the BASELINE, with the exception of the addition of several small warning icons and minor text reflows.  The addition of warning icons suggests a potential issue needs attention.  The text reflows are minor and likely due to minor differences in font rendering or browser behavior but warrant investigation to maintain consistency across different browsers and devices. The changes are not severe enough to hinder usability. The overall impact is minimal but the presence of the warning icons flags a potential problem that requires further investigation.

**Browser:** Firefox

**Total Visual Differences Found:** 6


**Detailed List of Differences:**

1. **Location:** "Cloud Solutions" service card
   - **Description:**  The last sentence has changed from "Scale your infrastructure efficiently with our reliable cloud computing services." to "Scale your infrastructure efficiently with our reliable cloud computing services."  Note that the change is *subtly* in spacing between the words.  It appears the Baseline has slightly tighter spacing.
   - **Severity:** Subtle

2. **Location:** "Mobile Development" service card
   - **Description:** The last sentence has changed from "Create engaging mobile experiences that connect with your customers everywhere." to "Create engaging mobile experiences that connect with your Customers everywhere." Note the capitalization difference in "customers."
   - **Severity:** Minor

3. **Location:** "Projects Completed" counter
   - **Description:** The number of projects has slightly changed in font rendering.  The baseline image shows a slightly more condensed/narrower digit rendering.
   - **Severity:** Subtle

4. **Location:** "Maria Johnson" team member card
   - **Description:** The text "Head of Cybersecurity" shows slightly different kerning or spacing between characters compared to the baseline image.
   - **Severity:** Subtle

5. **Location:** "Sarah Parker" team member card
   - **Description:** The text "PhD in Machine Learning" shows slightly different kerning or spacing between characters compared to the baseline image.
   - **Severity:** Subtle

6. **Location:** "Get In Touch" Section, Input Fields
   - **Description:** There's a very minor difference in the visual spacing (vertical padding) between the input fields in the "Get In Touch" section. The baseline version seems to have slightly less spacing. This is very subtle.
   - **Severity:** Subtle


**Overall Assessment of Visual Quality:**

The overall visual quality is very similar between the baseline and test screenshots.  Most differences are subtle variations in font rendering, kerning, or minor spacing discrepancies, likely due to minor variations in browser rendering or font handling.  While not technically identical, these differences are minor and unlikely to impact the user experience significantly.   The more significant differences are in the text content, which should be checked for accuracy.

    * **Severity:** Minor


**3. Overall Assessment of Visual Quality:**

The visual quality of the TEST image is mostly the same as the BASELINE. The addition of small icons to the service cards represents a change, but these are minor additions and do not significantly impact the overall layout, readability, or user experience.  The changes are consistent and follow a pattern, suggesting an intentional design update.  If these icons were part of a planned design update and are considered functional improvements (e.g., improved visual hierarchy, quicker identification of services), then the visual regression is acceptable.  However, if they were unexpected and potentially unintended, then further investigation is needed to understand their purpose and ensure they are consistent with the design specifications.
