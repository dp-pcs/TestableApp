However, you can manually review the following aspects for visual differences between the baseline and test images:\n\n1. **Color Changes**:\n   - **Header Text Color**: Check if the color of the \"TechCorp Solutions\" text in the header has changed.\n   - **Button Colors**: Ensure that the color of the \"Get Started Today\" button is consistent.\n\n2. **Text Alignment and Spacing**:\n   - **Font Size and Style**: Look for changes in font size or style across headings, paragraphs, and buttons.\n   - **Spacing**: Check for differences in padding or margin around sections, text, or images.\n\n3. **Layout Adjustments**:\n   - **Section Positioning**: Ensure that each section (Our Core Services, Meet Our Team, etc.) is aligned as expected.\n   - **Icons and Images**: Verify the position and size of icons and images in the sections.\n\n4. **Graphics and Icons**:\n   - **Icon Styles**: Confirm that the style of icons (e.g., shadow, outline) remains the same.\n   - **Image Quality**: Look for any differences in image resolution or quality.\n\n5. **Footer**:\n   - **Footer Text and Links**: Check for any changes in footer text size or color.\n   - **Copyright Information**: Verify the placement and alignment of the copyright text.\n\nIf you identify any issues from these areas, catalog them based on your observations and the severity level (Critical/Major/Minor/Subtle). For a detailed list, each point would need to be checked against your documentation of expected styles and layouts.",

Detailed List of Differences:**\n\n* **Difference 1:**\n    * **Location:** \"Meet Our Team\" section - John Smith's card\n    * **Description:** The text under John Smith's name (\"Chief Technology Officer...\") is slightly taller in the TEST image.  There's a minute difference in vertical spacing between the title and description.\n    * **Severity:** Subtle\n\n\n* **Difference 2:**\n    * **Location:** \"Meet Our Team\" section - Maria Johnson's card\n    * **Description:** Similar to John Smith's card, the text under Maria Johnson's name (\"Head of Cybersecurity...\")  has slightly more vertical spacing in the TEST image compared to the BASELINE.\n    * **Severity:** Subtle\n\n\n* **Difference 3:**\n    * **Location:** \"Meet Our Team\" section - David Lee's card\n    * **Description:** The text under David Lee's name (\"Cloud Solutions Architect...\") has slightly more vertical spacing in the TEST image compared to the BASELINE.\n    * **Severity:** Subtle\n\n\n* **Difference 4:**\n    * **Location:** \"Cross-Browser Excellence\" Section - Browser Logos and text\n    * **Description:** While not drastically different, a subtle change in spacing exists between the browser logos and their accompanying descriptions in the TEST image. This is most noticeable with the Safari logo and its text description.\n    * **Severity:** Subtle\n\n\n**3. Overall Assessment of Visual Quality:**\n\nThe visual quality between the BASELINE and TEST images is very similar.  The differences are all subtle variations in vertical spacing within the text blocks under team member names and a minimal shift in spacing within the cross-browser excellence section. These discrepancies are unlikely to be noticeable to the average user and do not significantly impact the overall layout or aesthetics of the website.  The visual regression is considered to be very minor and likely due to minor font rendering differences or inconsistencies in how different browsers handle spacing.\n",

The variations in spacing, in particular, should be addressed to ensure consistency across the interface.\n",
