- Both pages are "identical" according to traditional testing
- This is the FALSE CONFIDENCE problem

### 3. Visual AI Testing Reality (4 minutes)
**Say:** "Now let's see what AI-powered visual testing discovers..."

**Action:** Run visual tests
```bash
npm run test:broken-compare
```

**Highlight:**
- 10/10 differences detected
- Pixel-perfect accuracy
- Detailed explanations provided

### 4. Cross-Browser Demonstration (3 minutes)
**Say:** "One more advantage - cross-browser testing..."

**Action:** Run multi-browser tests
```bash
npm run test:baseline-playwright
```

**Show:**
